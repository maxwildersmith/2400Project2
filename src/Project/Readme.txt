#Project 2
This code implements the ADT Tree using recursion to create a Binary Search Tree in task1() of the Tester class, and is
automatically called by the main method of that class.
The second Task implements the ADT Heap in the form of a resizeable array Max Heap. This Heap can be created using a
sequential adding method, or the more optimal adding method. The data for the heap can also be user generated, or auto-
generated, and the swap count will be printed in either case.

#Usage
To run this code, run the main method of Tester and follow the command prompts.
To run the JAR file, run java -jar 2400.jar located in out > artifacts > 2400_jar > 2400.jar
